Master Build Prompt
You are building a ‚ÄúMedia Diet Tracker‚Äù for lnara.com inspired by consumed.today.

## GOAL
The system should:
- Collect media consumption automatically (Spotify via Last.fm API, YouTube via YouTube Data API).
- Allow manual additions (articles, tweets, other).
- Store all entries in Google Sheets (used as a database, but never exposed directly).
- Provide a private curation dashboard at /draft/consumed where I can review the week‚Äôs items.
- Let me mark entries public/private, add notes, and publish.
- Generate a public digest page at /consumed/[week] with entries grouped day-by-day and bucketed by type.

## STORAGE
- Backend: Google Sheets.
- One sheet named `media_log`.
- Columns:


id | date | bucket | title | url | source | notes | is_public | created_at

- Bucket values: music, video, article, tweet, other.

## INGESTERS
- Spotify:
- Connect via Last.fm API (scrobbling enabled).
- Script pulls recent tracks for a given user/API key and appends rows.
- YouTube:
- Connect via YouTube Data API (OAuth once).
- Script pulls recent watch history and appends rows.
- Support a blocklist of channels/videoIds and per-video privacy overrides.

## DASHBOARD (/draft/consumed)
- Auth: simple password from .env.
- Pull last 7 days of rows from the Sheet.
- Group items by Day (Mon‚ÄìSun).
- Inside each day, group by bucket.
- For each entry:
- Show title, url, source.
- Editable notes field.
- Toggle public/private.
- Add form to manually add entries (article, tweet, other).
- Button: **Publish Week**:
- Collect last 7 days where is_public=true.
- Generate static file under /public/consumed/YYYY-WW/index.html.

## PUBLIC PAGES (/consumed/[week])
- Static, no Google Sheets queries.
- Layout:
- Header: ‚ÄúMedia Consumed ‚Äî Week [WW], YYYY‚Äù
- Show each day of the week in order.
- If no entries for a day, show ‚ÄúNo entries‚Äù.
- Within each day, group items by bucket.
- Items shown as bullet points: `[Title](URL) ‚Äî Notes`.
- Styling: Tailwind CSS, clean and simple, like consumed.today.

## CONFIG
- .env variables:
- SHEETS_ID
- GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON
- LASTFM_USER
- LASTFM_API_KEY
- YOUTUBE_CLIENT_SECRET
- YOUTUBE_TOKEN_PATH
- DASHBOARD_PASSWORD
- BASE_URL

## DELIVERABLES
1. Server app (FastAPI or Express) with routes:
 - /draft/consumed (dashboard)
 - /publish/week (publish action)
 - /consumed/[week] (public digest)
2. Scripts:
 - ingest_lastfm.py
 - ingest_youtube.py
3. Frontend:
 - dashboard.html (private, with forms, toggles, notes, publish button)
 - published.html template (for static digest pages)
4. Config:
 - .env.example
 - blocklist.json, privacy_overrides.json
5. Docs:
 - README.md with setup steps:
   - Create Google Sheet + API credentials.
   - Enable Last.fm scrobbling + API key.
   - Enable YouTube Data API + OAuth.
   - Deploy app to lnara.com.
   - Use dashboard weekly to curate and publish.

## USER FLOW
- During the week:
- Ingester scripts auto-append Spotify + YouTube to Google Sheet.
- User may add articles/tweets manually through dashboard form.
- On Sunday:
- User logs into /draft/consumed.
- Reviews items day by day, toggles public/private, adds notes.
- Clicks **Publish Week**.
- Public:
- Anyone can visit /consumed/[week] to see the digest page.
- Digest shows day-by-day breakdown, grouped by bucket.
What you tell them

Public repo (Cloudflare Pages):

Contains only /consumed/[week] HTML files, CSS, assets.

No secrets.

Static, auto-built from GitHub commits.

Private backend (Cloudflare Worker or small VPS):

Hosts /draft/consumed dashboard (password-protected).

Talks to Google Sheets API (service account key stored in Worker/VPS secrets).

Runs ingesters for Last.fm + YouTube.

Generates static digest pages.

Pushes those digest pages to your public GitHub repo (via commit + deploy key) OR directly to Cloudflare R2/Pages API.

üü° How they‚Äôll implement

Repo split

media-diet-public (on GitHub, public) ‚Üí your Cloudflare Pages site.

media-diet-backend (private) ‚Üí Worker/VPS code.

Workflow

During the week: backend fills Google Sheet.

Sunday: you log into lnara.com/draft/consumed (served by backend).

You curate ‚Üí hit Publish.

Backend writes HTML digest ‚Üí pushes into media-diet-public repo.

Cloudflare Pages rebuilds ‚Üí new digest goes live at lnara.com/consumed/[week].

Secrets

Service account JSON, Last.fm API key, YouTube OAuth creds ‚Üí stored only in Worker secrets or VPS .env.

Never in public repo.

ADDENDUM ‚Äî Confirmed Decisions and Implementation TODO (America/New_York)

Confirmed Decisions

- Timezone: America/New_York; use ISO week (Mon‚ÄìSun) for grouping and publishing.
- Ingestion cadence: daily at 11:00 PM ET (handled via UTC cron + local-time gate).
- YouTube ingestion: use "Liked videos" as proxy for watch history; user will like every watched video.
- Spotify ingestion: via Last.fm recent tracks for LASTFM_USER.
- Navigation: add ‚ÄúConsumed‚Äù link only after first publish (target next Sunday).
- No email export for now.

Privacy & Repo Strategy

- Public repo (this site on Cloudflare Pages): contains only published static digests in `/public/consumed/YYYY-WW/` and an index at `/public/consumed/index.html`. No draft rows, no secrets.
- Private backend (Cloudflare Worker or small VPS; vanilla Worker routing is sufficient ‚Äî Hono optional):
  - Password-protected dashboard at `/draft/consumed` (or `draft.lnara.com/consumed`).
  - Google Sheets access via service account stored as a secret.
  - Daily ingesters (Last.fm + YouTube Likes) at 11 PM ET.
  - Publish Week renders static HTML and pushes to the public repo via deploy key or Cloudflare Pages Direct Upload API.

Google Sheet Schema (media_log)

`id | date | bucket | title | url | source | notes | is_public | created_at | updated_at`

- Buckets: `music | video | article | tweet | other`.
- IDs:
  - Last.fm: `hash(artist|track|timestamp)`
  - YouTube Likes: `youtube:videoId|likedAt`
  - Manual: UUID v4

Dashboard (/draft/consumed)

- Auth via password; set HTTP-only session cookie; add `noindex`.
- View last 7 days (ET), grouped by day then bucket.
- Each entry: title, url, source; editable notes; toggle `is_public`.
- Manual add: article/tweet/other.
- Publish Week: generate `/consumed/YYYY-WW/index.html` and update `/consumed/index.html`.

Public Pages (/consumed/[YYYY-WW])

- Pure static HTML; no live Google Sheets queries.
- Header: `Media Consumed ‚Äî Week [WW], YYYY`.
- Show Mon‚ÄìSun; if empty day ‚Üí ‚ÄúNo entries‚Äù.
- Group items by bucket; bullet format: `[Title](URL) ‚Äî Notes`.
- Styling: inline CSS within the digest or a small `/consumed/style.css`.

Cron & Time Handling

- Cloudflare Cron uses UTC ‚Üí schedule at 03:00 and 04:00 UTC.
- In code, compute America/New_York time; proceed only when local hour === 23 and today not processed (dedupe with KV/Sheet meta).

Publishing Flow

- Select ISO week; pull rows with `is_public=true` for that week.
- Render static digest + update index of weeks.
- Commit to this public repo via deploy key, or use Pages Direct Upload API. No secrets committed.

Backend Deliverables

- Worker/VPS routes:
  - `GET /draft/consumed` ‚Äî dashboard
  - `POST /api/entries` ‚Äî manual create
  - `POST /api/entries/:id` ‚Äî update notes/is_public
  - `POST /publish/week?week=YYYY-WW` ‚Äî publish action
- Ingesters (scheduled daily):
  - `ingest_lastfm` (recent tracks)
  - `ingest_youtube_likes`
- Config (in private backend repo): `.env.example` with
  - `SHEETS_ID`, `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`, `LASTFM_USER`, `LASTFM_API_KEY`, `YOUTUBE_CLIENT_ID`, `YOUTUBE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD`, `PUBLIC_REPO`, `PUBLIC_REPO_BRANCH`, `GITHUB_DEPLOY_KEY`
  - `blocklist.json`, `privacy_overrides.json`
- Docs: setup, secrets, cron, publish flow, and commit-to-public instructions.

Acceptance Criteria

- Private dashboard shows last 7 days grouped by day and bucket; notes/toggles work; manual add works.
- Daily ingestion runs at 11 PM ET and appends deduped rows.
- Publish Week creates `/public/consumed/YYYY-WW/index.html` and updates `/public/consumed/index.html` in this repo.
- No draft/private data lands in the public repo; nav link added only after first publish.
