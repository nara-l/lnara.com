This is my first week of codding with AfroVisioN(AVN) Team at the AVN Lab.It has not been easy for me as I have to embrace a new community, a new team, new Ideas and Technology.The team is a great one because they are determined and want to make it.Making it here means changing the conventional thought of doing things for money. They portray the love for their work.They do it because they wish to see a better Cameroon and Africa in the realm of Software Development;Doing it because they know there is to be a change;a hope for a better future of Software development in Africa. I think they have to do it because if they don't someone else would. I have been indroduced to a new framework, Codeigniter(CI).CI is a framework with built in functions to make Php programming very easy.You can achieve many  tasks seamlessly.This is thanks to the team at EllisLab;Hi!!!.I am familiar with Php and MySQL but the framework is a new story to me.It comes with the idea of some Object Oriented Programming. The idea of Model VIew and Controller(MVC).Basically, MVC .The Model is the handler of the data;View is the handler of the user interface and controller for mediation between the model and the view. At first it is never easy;"How come I see it like a mystery and you see it so easy!!!???.I think familiarity is the answer.To be come familiar with a new skill; time and Practice are not left as the company of the word. As I get familiar I  get to achieve tasks I had imagined would take several days in few hours.As now I am progressing at my liking speed and not under lot's of pressure from the project manager;Churchill who is also an Inspiration to me. The major problems I face now is mixing my corporate life with my personal life.I love to keep the lives apart.At least in theory.This Blog is supposed to keep track of my corporate life as a Software developer now under AfroVisioN.My thoughts may stray in.I am trying my best to fit into this new id.I am fitting well and getting it.Apart from this I like to keep my life out of the eye of the public (Even away from God if it where Possible). Out of writing programs that I find as fun,respect and like so much, I can be found Listening to Music(Now mostly indie and Rock/Alternative,POP,Punk,some Emo).My music player is good for me. Movies, Adverts, Travel, art, reading, writing (all of it stay in My  wall robe except the ones you see now and few others...hahahaha),the acquisition of a new property.....You may also find me thinking about mankind's biggest problems(Emotions).
