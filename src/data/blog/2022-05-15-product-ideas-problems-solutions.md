[Google Maps](#maps) [Ideas](#ideas) **Google Maps**

I use Google Maps almost every day. Itâ€™s been one of my top 3 apps since I moved to the US. Maps are important to me because they help me discover new places. New places and new visualizations light up my brain. I feel a surge of dopamine and happiness each time I see a new route or a new place. It feels very good and my creativity also fires up. **Ideas**

-   **Randomized Routes for Regular Destinations**: If time is not an issue, Google Maps could randomize routes for regular destinations. For example, if I use Google Maps to play soccer every Saturday, the app could pick new routes for me to use to arrive at my destination.
-   **Scenic Routes Option**: Scenic routes should be an option. They could be admin-curated, but for every destination, I should be able to click on a scenic route and choose which one I want to use. Selecting "avoid highways" is not necessarily a scenic route. There could be multiple scenic routes, and the user can choose which one they want to try.
-   **Interactive Maps**: The map can interact more with the user, not just give instructions. A more human-like map that talks back with the user would enhance the experience.
