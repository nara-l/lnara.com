This is not the most weird Christmas eve I've ever had. But today is memorable cause I've spent time with something I love [Wasamundi](http://www.wasamundi.com/) . Around such a time last year, I can recall I was rolling on my bed with high fever after I left my favorite uncle and Mentor (Madiba) Molua at a Dinner party on Invitation. I'm almost in tears each time I think how such days used to be before I became an entrepreneur. I hope to spend sometime with my girl friend today. Hope that helps :) I was programming how users shall be rewarded at the end of the year: [Xmas and New year package from Wasamundi.](http://www.wasamundi.com/package/xmas_newyear) I think I'm done and I'm rolling it out in under 30mins. The code will give a user wasamundi credit. But 2 users may not have the same amount of credit. The max a user can have is 10 and the min is 5. I've had fun today cos I did some cool javascript stuff too :). Thanking [speckyboy](http://speckyboy.com/) for the wallpaper. it's meant for desktop but I've using it for web :).
