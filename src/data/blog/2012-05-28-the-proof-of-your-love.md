If  I sing but don't have love I waste my breath with every song I bring an empty voice, a hollow noise If I speak with a silver tongue Convince a crowd but don't have love I leave a bitter taste with every word I saySo let my life be the proof, The proof of Your love Let my love look like You and what You're made of How You lived, how You died Love is sacrifice So let my life be the proof, The proof of Your loveIf I give To a needy soul but don't have love then who is poor? It seems all the poverty is found in me So let my life be the proof, The proof of Your love Let my love look like You and what You're made of How You lived, how You died Love is sacrifice Oh, let my life be the proof, The proof of Your love When it's all said and done When we sing our final song Only love remains Only love remains Let my life be the proof, The proof of Your love Let my love look like You and what You're made of How You lived, how You died Love is sacrifice So let my life be the proof, The proof of Your love.

Something is right about the song. The lyrics, the music, may be everything

For King and Country - album crave.
