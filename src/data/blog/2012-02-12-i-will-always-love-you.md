I had a premonition yesterday. I told Quincy and some friends I was hanging out with that: "*Someone I know or Someone connected to me is about to die*". Well, I'm not sure it was about this death, except part of me was actually deep rooted in the singer's songs of which I did pay less attention to this connection till now?!. This morning getting up at 7:00am I learn from [It's Quincy](http://quincykwende.blogspot.com/) and [Facebook](http://facebook.com/) that the Legendary singer [Whitney Houston](http://www.whitneyhouston.com/us/home) is dead, today 12th, February, 2012 at 3:00am at 48.
