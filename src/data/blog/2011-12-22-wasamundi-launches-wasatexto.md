Earlier this year, at Barcamp Cameroon 2011, I gave a presentation on the future of  [Wasamundi.com](http://wasamundi.com/).

**[Wasamundi presentation - Barcamp Cameroon 2011](http://www.slideshare.net/naral/wasamundi-presentation-barcamp-cameroon-2011 "Wasamundi presentation - Barcamp Cameroon 2011")**

View more [presentations](http://www.slideshare.net/) from [naral](http://www.slideshare.net/naral). I talked about how the people and businesses shall communicate on Wasamundi platform and the different services to follow.

Yesterday, wasamundi announced one of their services which was talked about during that event. [WasaTEXTO](http://www.wasatexto.com/). Some of the goals of WasaTEXTO are: 

-   **Permit anybody to reach everybody and anywhere.**
-   **Reach all the people who matter in your life at once via SMS.**
