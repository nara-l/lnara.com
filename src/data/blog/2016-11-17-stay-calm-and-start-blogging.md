The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant. I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why. Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? Saving the world with meals on wheels. I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister. Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. You've swallowed a planet!
