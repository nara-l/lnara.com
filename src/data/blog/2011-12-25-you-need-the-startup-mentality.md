While reading news on this most unusual Christmas morning, I stumbled on the article by [Marty Zwilling](http://www.caycon.com/consultant-Marty-Zwilling.php "Visit Marty Zwilling’s website") called ["Do You Have the Mentality to Manage a Startup?"](http://wasa.me/Ru8H) . I related with all the points. But up till today I've not had an acceptable definition of success but his is just lovely. He writes:

> " Beyond that, I believe success is a state of mind derived from confidence, self esteem, and what you really want in life."

That says it all! so lovely, thanks man and keep doing your great job. So, I concluded to succeed as an entrepreneur, you need the Startup Mentality. Unfortunately I live in a community where the startup mentality is still being adopted unlike [Silicon valley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley) . Hopefully we shall get there no matter how long it takes.

Enjoy your Christmas with Christ and Merry responsibly.
