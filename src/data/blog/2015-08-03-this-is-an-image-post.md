[![l-04](/images/l-04.jpg)](http://themes.pixelwars.org/theblogger/default/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2016/08/l-04.jpg) You’ve swallowed a planet! Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I’ve always known him: Jeff. I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don’t lie to me! \*Insistently\* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I’m a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do!
