I enjoyed the quote from Richard Branson which I uplifted for my diary:)

Those early years were tough, he [told Entrepreneur](http://us.lrd.yahoo.com/_ylt=AtI5Fd9H0gZZI20.Hq8HmAPy6IdG;_ylu=X3oDMTFrM2g5cm4zBG1pdANBcnRpY2xlIEJvZHkEcG9zAzExBHNlYwNNZWRpYUFydGljbGVCb2R5QXNzZW1ibHk-;_ylg=X3oDMTNqZDE2Z3FyBGludGwDdXMEbGFuZwNlbi11cwRwc3RhaWQDMzFlMjA4MjUtYzdiNS0zMmI5LWI4OGUtNzY4ODYxNjYyYTE2BHBzdGNhdANwZXJzb25hbGZpbmFuY2V8Y2FyZWVyLWVkdWNhdGlvbgRwdANzdG9yeXBhZ2U-;_ylv=0/SIG=12e41pclk/EXP=1365670032/**http%3A//www.entrepreneur.com/article/225295%23ixzz2OD7BTC2C):

> *"I remember them vividly. It's far more difficult being a small-business owner starting a business than it is for me with thousands of people working for us and 400 companies. Building a business from scratch is 24 hours, 7 days a week, divorces, it's difficult to hold your family life together, it's bloody hard work and only one word really matters — and that's surviving."*

This quote is a reminder of the many times the company ([Wasamundi](http://wasamundi.com)) that I'm building with my pal @[quincy\_k](https://x.com/Quincy_K) was at the tipping point. Many times we reached the point where we thought, "This is it. We are done." But each time, something beyond our control happened to pull us out of the situation. I believe it's our deep instinct to survive. I always remind myself that the most essential thing is staying alive. If you die, no one will remember what you wanted to do. Staying alive is the most important thing for an entrepreneur. It's the most important thing in life, anyway.
