###                                          Midnight In Paris.

Finished watching it and I'm drawn to this type of movies.

Surely because I'm a writer in disguise :), or the movie actually speaks in my own voice or it speaks to me in a familiar voice.

The story inspires living in the now; in the moment. There is no greener pasture over the hedge and no better moment than now.

I fell in love with the city of Paris **{an old love :)}** and [Marion Cotillard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marion_Cotillard).
