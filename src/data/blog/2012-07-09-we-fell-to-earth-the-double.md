Lyrics: i don't care what u said so long ago the double and the same one it don't move what the .. save anyone .. i can't tell if the thoughts mean anything u don't ever say why no offense .. the double and the same one.. same sign.. same sign.. same sign.. same sign.. i don't care what u did so long ago the double and the same one it don't move when the thought fell anyone it shook and it can't stay right you never look what u say and u mean u only look and u see what's in the mirror u never look at what u see in a mirror u wanna look at what u see under a mirror same sign.. same sign.. same sign.. same sign..
