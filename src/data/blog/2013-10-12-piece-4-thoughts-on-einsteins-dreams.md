> 24 APRIL 1905 "In this world, there are two times. There is mechanical time and there is body time".

We live in a world where two types of time coexist: body time and mechanical time. These two manifestations of time are measured either by mechanical devices or by our own bodies. Before 1275, when the Italian monk designed the first mechanical clock, our world had only one time: body time. Body time is impulsive and unpredictable, changing its mind as it goes. Each new second presents infinite possibilities. In most cases, we donâ€™t have control over body time, making it imprecise. **Examples of Body Time:**

-   A man decides to buy food because he feels hungry, responding to body time.
-   A CEO leaves a board meeting to visit the toilet, prompted by body time.
-   An African migrant working long hours in America breaks down after continuous work. Their body time tells them to see a doctor, take medication, and resume work once the pain subsides. This cycle can continue throughout their life.

Body time influences major life decisions, such as marrying when the impulse strikes or having children when the body signals readiness. People who rely solely on body time live in a world governed by these internal cues. **Mechanical Time:** Immanuel Kant is a famous example of someone who lived by mechanical time. It is said he was so punctual that local housewives set their clocks by his daily routine. He used mechanical time, driven by the pendulum of a clock, to structure his life precisely.

-   He woke up at exactly 6 chimes of the clock.
-   He started eating breakfast at the 7th chime.
-   He arrived at work at exactly 7:30 am.
-   He ate lunch at the 12th chime and finished work at 5:30 pm.
-   He went to his club every Tuesday, leaving at exactly 10 pm and arriving home at 10:15 pm, then went to bed at 11 pm.

People who use mechanical time follow a rigid schedule, dictated by the clock. This precision can sometimes clash with those who follow body time. **Coexistence of Body Time and Mechanical Time:** In our world, a person can choose to live by body time, mechanical time, or a combination of both. Each approach allows for a moral and good life, but the experience will differ significantly:

-   **Body Time**: Allows for spontaneity and responsiveness to internal cues.
-   **Mechanical Time**: Provides structure and predictability.
-   **Combined Approach**: Balances the benefits of both, offering flexibility and order.

**Lessons:** It becomes clear that time cannot exist independently; it needs a manifestation through either our bodies or mechanical devices. The concept of time, as we understand it, is intertwined with our methods of measurement. **Disclaimer:** Apart from the quotes used to draw parallels to our world and daily activities, every other thought is my own and may be subject to discussion and investigation. The precision attributed to Immanuel Kant is exaggerated for illustrative purposes.
