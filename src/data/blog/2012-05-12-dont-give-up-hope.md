From time to time while in the pursuit of our dreams, we are faced with circumstances.

Some of them may deter  us and propel despair so bad that you fall into the "**state**" of  forgetting your original purpose.

 Sometimes someone will slap you out of it. Most times you'll survive because you can slap yourself out: don't give up hope!


A proper depiction of what I'm trying to say from my new all time favorite anime -- Code Geass :)
