I spent some quality time today away from my computer. I mean from writing codes cause I've been watching movies from the computer :). I picked "**Drive**" as one of the best movies for this year: I love the soundtrack by the College feat. Electric Youth - A Real Hero. Then I ask who is a real hero. I think every human being who successfully lives through the challenges of a day is a Hero: A Real Hero. Enjoy the lyrics of the song and the song:

 

**‘A Real Hero’**

Real human being, being… (repeat) and a real hero, hero… (repeat)

Back against the wall at odds With the strength of the will and a cause Your pursuits are called “outstanding”, though emotionally complex.

Against the grain of dystopic claims of the thoughts your actions entertain, and you have proved to be

A real human being, and a real hero, Real human being, and a real hero, Real human being, and a real hero, Real human being, and a real hero, Real human being (repeat)

A pilot on a cold, cold morn, One hundred fifty-five people on board, All safe and all rescued, From the slowly sinking ship.

All are warmer than his head so cool, In that tight bind knew what to do, and you have proved to be

A real human being, and a real hero, Real human being, and a real hero, Real human being, and a real hero, Real human being, and a real hero, Real human being, Real human being,

Real human being (To fade)

***College feat. Electric Youth*** ‘A Real Hero’
