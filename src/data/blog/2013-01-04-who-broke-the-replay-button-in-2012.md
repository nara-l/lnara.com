2012 went too soon. In 2011 I published [who broke the replay button in 2011](http://njielitumbe.blogspot.com/2012_01_01_archive.html) ( basically about the songs I played and appreciated the most). So this is the compilation of songs I played more last year. I could not arrange which is supposed to come first, lets say in any other of equal importance.

1. [ðŸŽµ Band of Horses - Funeral](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Band+of+Horses+Funeral) (Not a very pretty video, but great music)

Cadeaux: My love for adverts caused me to find this Song today. From the Nissan Leap advert

Favourite song for last year Funeral - Band of Horses. I can recall in one of these instances I found my self playing this song from my iPod in a Funeral, that was how addictive the song was. I'm also planing to do a cover for Miike's snow Black tin box featuring Lykke Lee :) Happy New year!
