2013 sped to its end. There are things I enjoyed and things I did not enjoy. This quote was my best of 2013:

> "Waiting too long before acting is equally unfair to the people who need to get off the bus. For every minute you allow a person to continue holding a seat when you know that person will not make it in the end, you're stealing a portion of his life, time that he could spend finding a better place where he could flourish." - Jim Collins
