https://vimeo.com/32214896 And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it. Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away! Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages! You mean while I'm sleeping in it? Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells. Of all the friends I've hadâ€¦ you're the first.
